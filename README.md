## Overview
This dataset provides insights into dietary habits, BMI classifications, exercise levels, and their impacts on health scores in the Indian population. The data aims to understand the relationship between diet types, physical activity, and health outcomes

## Key Features of the Dataset

- Diet Types:
Non-Vegetarian: Individuals consuming meat and animal products.
Vegetarian: Individuals consuming plant-based diets with dairy but no meat.
Vegan: Individuals consuming strictly plant-based diets without any animal products.

- BMI

- Exercise Levels
  Sedentary: Minimal physical activity.
  Moderate: Average physical activity.
  Active: Regular and intensive physical activity.

- Health Score:
- A numerical value ranging from 0 to 100, representing overall health based on BMI, exercise, and diet.

## Purpose

The dataset helps to analyze:
- The prevalence of different BMI groups among diet types.
- The distribution of exercise levels across BMI categories.
- The impact of dietary habits on obesity and other health metrics.

## Observations from Preliminary Analysis

Health Scores:

- The distribution of health scores is fairly uniform, with no extreme skewness or kurtosis.
- Morbid obesity correlates with slightly higher variance in health scores.

Diet and BMI:
- Non-vegetarians and vegetarians dominate in "Moderate Obesity" and "Overweight" categories.
  
- Vegans show fewer instances of obesity but lower representation overall.

BMI and Exercise Levels:
- Sedentary individuals are more likely to belong to the "Overweight" and "Moderate Obesity" categories.

- Active individuals are concentrated more in the "Normal" BMI category.
