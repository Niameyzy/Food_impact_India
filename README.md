## Overview
This dataset provides insights into how different food habits influence the health and lifestyle of individuals in India. The dataset captures details like age, region, diet type, cuisine preferences, calorie intake, and health outcomes. The data aims to understand the relationship between these variables and health outcomes.


## Key Features of the Dataset

- Diet Type:
Non-Vegetarian: Individuals consuming meat and animal products.
Vegetarian: Individuals consuming plant-based diets with dairy but no meat.
Vegan: Individuals consuming strictly plant-based diets without any animal products.

- BMI

- Exercise Levels
  Sedentary: Minimal physical activity.
  Moderate: Average physical activity.
  Active: Regular and intensive physical activity.

- Health Score:
- A numerical value ranging from 0 to 100, representing overall health based on BMI, exercise, and diet.


## Purpose

The dataset helps to analyze:
- The prevalence of different BMI groups among diet types.
- The distribution of exercise levels across BMI categories.
- The impact of dietary habits on obesity and other health metrics.


## Observations from Preliminary Analysis

Health Scores:

- The distribution of health scores is fairly uniform, with no extreme skewness or kurtosis.
- Morbid obesity correlates with slightly higher variance in health scores.

Diet and BMI:
- Non-vegetarians and vegetarians dominate in "Moderate Obesity" and "Overweight" categories.
  
- Vegans show fewer instances of obesity but lower representation overall.

BMI and Exercise Levels:
- Sedentary individuals are more likely to belong to the "Overweight" and "Moderate Obesity" categories.

- Active individuals are concentrated more in the "Normal" BMI category.


## Conclusion

Beyond the type of diet; Consumption of sugar and salt can also modify our health score. Depending on whether we are in the environment in which we live (rural or urban), eating habits differ and can therefore impact our health score.
